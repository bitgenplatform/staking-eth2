During the fall of 2022, the Ethereum network is expected transition from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake. That is to say that the Ethereum network no longer validates transactions by minors but by validating servers.

Here you will find all the necessary tools for an implementation of an Ethereum2.0 validator

> ###### **ATTENTION:** The implementation of an Ethereum2.0 masternode is a complex operation requiring investment and specialized maintenance. We are in no way responsible for the poor implementation of your node and/or the loss of your assets.
> ###### If you still want to set up your own validator, **we strongly advise you** to start with the ***Testnet Prater*** network before moving on to the Mainnet
